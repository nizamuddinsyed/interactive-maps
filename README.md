# Interactive Maps with Touch and Feel

Welcome to a novel approach to map interaction that engages users through touch and feel!

## Overview

This repository contains three distinct projects, all developed using cvzone, OpenCV and the Mediapipe library extensively. Each project is written entirely in Python, leveraging the power of computer vision and AI to create engaging and interactive map-based experiences.

### Project 1: Finger Touch Hamburg Districts
The first project focuses on highlighting districts in Hamburg, Germany, based on user touch input. Users can interact with the map, touch any district, and see it highlighted, providing an immersive and informative experience.

### Project 2: Estimated Travel Time (ETT) between Two Districts
In the second project, users can explore the estimated travel time between two districts in Hamburg. Leveraging AI algorithms, this feature provides valuable insights into the time it takes to travel between different areas, enhancing the utility of the map.

### Project 3: Quiz Game
The third project introduces a gamified experience, featuring a quiz game about Hamburg districts. Users can enjoy answering intriguing questions about the districts, and the system provides instant feedback on the correctness of their responses. This gamification element adds an element of fun and interactivity to the exploration of Hamburg.

## Technologies Used

- OpenCV
- Mediapipe
- Python

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. First RUN, getMap and getDistricts file (Step1 and Step2)
4. Run each project individually by executing the Python scripts associated with them.

## Enjoy the Gamified Experience!

Experience the thrill of interacting with maps in a new and exciting way. Whether you're exploring districts, estimating travel times, or testing your knowledge with a quiz, these projects bring a touch-and-feel element to map navigation, making it both educational and enjoyable. Have fun!
